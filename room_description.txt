As you open the door you feel a wave of heat hit you. \n All around you in the room you see flaming fires \n You don't want to go inside the room but you do it anyways.
A door made of riveted steel, the air seem to vibrate around it
Oooooooh bricks, I love bricks \n And moss ... \n 
A common wooden door, \n almost a bit boring \n compared to everything else you have seen
A stench fill your nose as you walk into the room \n And as you step into the room you realise you've made a mistake \n You've stepped into a puddle 
A door \n but it isn't? \n it looks more like a round slab of steel
